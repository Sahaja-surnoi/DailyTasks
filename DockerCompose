Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
It simplifies the process of managing complex applications that involve multiple services 
by allowing you to define all the services, networks, and volumes in a single file, typically
called docker-compose.yml. This file uses YAML syntax to specify how Docker containers should 
be configured and connected.
