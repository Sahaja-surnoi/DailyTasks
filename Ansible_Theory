Ansible
-Configuration management tool-Agentless
-Provisioning like ec2,s3
-In cicd, Deploy artifacts in to multiple manage nodes or Kubernetes cluster
-Network automation
-------------------------------------------
1.control node
2.manage node-slaves-only python need to be installed
------------------------------------------
**Ansible vs Python vs Shell
->Installing oracle

Shell script: If os are diff like Linux and windows the same script wont work

Python: Need to know pthon, maintenance req if python is updated, need to login to all the vm's and need to run python
-Talking to API like raise jira and GitHub then we can use python over ansible

Ansible: Need not login to all the vm's. we can use inventory where we mention all the ip addresses. agent less.
---------------------------------------------------
-> we can connect with or without password
1.ssh key way
2.password way
--------------------------
ssh -i <path to pem file> ubuntu@<ip address>

#enable password authentication
-> vim  /etc/ssh/sshd_config-> here un comment password authentication
->sudo systemctl restart ssh

#create password for ubuntu
NP
Retype
Logout

now if we do ssh-copy-id ubuntu@ip
-it asks for password
------------------------------------
inventory
1.inventory.ini
vim inventory.ini
[app]
ubuntu@managenodeip
[db]
ubuntu@managenode2
-it can be in any location and we can use it in ansible or /etc/ansible/hosts(default)
2.yml
-----------------------------------
-In ansible there are 2 ways to give instrucytions
1.playbooks-installing oracle which has so many commands
2.Adhoc commands-simple commands like-> restarting, installing apache etc
##syntax: 
-ansible (inventoryfile location) (-m any module) -a(argument) servers
-ansible (inventoryfile location) -m shell -a apt update db/all

-ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping(exact command) all(what are the servers)
-ansible -i inventory.ini -m shell -a "apt install openjdk" all/ubuntu@managenodeip
------------------------------------------
Roles:
take a ansible playbook->split them in to different sections and put them in a folder and put them in 1 umbrella
-readability, modularity and sharing across the teams
- ansible-galaxy role init <role name>
- ls -ltr
------------------------------------------
execution of playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini first-playbook.yml
