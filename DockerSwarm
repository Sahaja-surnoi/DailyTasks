We can use GUI for docker swarm known as "swarmpit"
-go to browser and search swarmpit and paste the given command in manager node
-take manager node instance ip with port 888 <ip:888>, we can check all the things here
-------------------------------------------

-To check which is manager node and worker node
docker node ls
---------------------
-To initialize the node, it will be manager node, get ip address using 'ifconfig'
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip ddress of instance>
----------------------
#we will get a command in output. copy and paste that command in worker node instance. 
#Do check if worker node is available or not in manager node using

docker node ls
----------------------
-create a service in manager node
docker service create --name <nameofservice> alpine ping socker.com

-check list of services
docker service ls

-check all the details of service
docker inspect <servicename>
--------------------------------
-deploying stack
docker stack deploy -c <composefilename> <stackname>
docker stack deploy -c <docker-compose.yml> <mern_stack>

-list of stacks
docker stack ls

-list stack details
docker stack ps <stack name>

-remove stack
docker stack rm <stackname>

docker stack services <stack name>

-To remove worker node, go to worker node (node leaves the swarm)
docker swarm leave

-to remove node
docker node rm <node name>

-to remove manager node
docker swarm leave --force
--------------------------
-list of networks
docker network ls

-create a network_overlay
docker network create -d overlay <network name>

-remove network
docker network rm <network name>
