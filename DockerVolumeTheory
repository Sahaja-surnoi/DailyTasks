Docker Volumes: Docker volumes are nothing but storage that is managed by Docker. Volumes are located in the container's filesystem. Data stores in Volumes persist(Do not delete) even after containers are deleted or updated.

 Advantages
------------
1.Data Persistence
example:If you’re running a database container, the database files can be stored in a volume. If you update the container or restart it, your database data remains intact(unchanged).

2.Managing Data Between Multiple Containers(multiple containers use same volume)
Sometimes, multiple containers need to share access to the same data
-Volumes can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously. This allows different containers to read from and write to the same volume.
Example: You might have a web server container and a logging container. Both can access a shared volume where logs are written, enabling centralized logging and monitoring.
-Web Server Container: The web server writes log files (e.g., access logs, error logs) to its internal filesystem. If this container is restarted or replaced, the logs might not be easily accessible or persist.
-Logging Container: To analyze or aggregate logs, this container needs access to the logs generated by the web server.

3.Isolation from Host Filesystem

4.Backup and Recovery are easy
We can create volumes in external compute or storage resources like s3, ec2

Docker provides tools to easily back up and restore volumes. You can use docker run commands to create backup containers that access the volume and copy data out.
Example: Regularly back up the volume containing your application’s data to a remote storage solution, ensuring that you can recover it if needed.

5. Consistent Data Access Across Different Environments
Different environments (development, testing, production) may require access to the same data or configuration, by using volumes we can do that.

6.Performance Optimization
if our host is not high performance then we can create volumes in high performance storage source so that performance is good
